# Noughts-X-Crosses
Noughts and Crosses, also known as Tic-Tac-Toe, is a classic paper-and-pencil game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols, traditionally "O" for noughts and "X" for crosses. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of one's own symbols.
